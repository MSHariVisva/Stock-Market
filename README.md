# Stock-Analysis

  In this project I attempt to implement machine learning approach to predict stock
prices. Machine learning is effectively implemented in forecasting stock prices. The objective
is to predict the stock prices in order to make more informed and accurate investment decisions.
We propose a stock price prediction system that integrates mathematical functions, machine
learning, and other external factors for the purpose of achieving better stock prediction
accuracy and issuing profitable trades. There are two types of stocks. You may know of
intraday trading by the commonly used term "day trading." Interday traders hold securities
positions from at least one day to the next and often for several days to weeks or months.
LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able to store past
information. This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in
predicting its future price. While predicting the actual price of a stock is an uphill climb, I 
can build a model that will predict whether the price will go up or down. 

  I present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach to predict stock market
indices,particularly with respect to the forecast of their trend movements up or down.
Exploiting different Neural Networks architectures, I provide numerical analysis of concrete
financial time series. In particular, after a brief resume of the existing literature on the subject,
we consider the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks techniques. I focus
on the importance of choosing the correct input features, along with their preprocessing, for
the specific learning algorithm one wants to use. Eventually, I consider the S&P500
historical time series, predicting trend on the basis of data from the past days, and proposing
a novel approach based on combination of wavelets and CNN, which outperforms the basic
neural networks ones. I show, that neural networks are able to predict financial time series
movements even trained only on plain time series data and propose more ways to improve
results.
